<p style="font-family:courier;"><b>HTML is really a very simple language</b>. It consists of ordinary
text, with commands that are
enclosed by "&lt;" and "&gt;" characters, or between an "&" and a ";". You don't really need to
knoe much that HTML to create a page, because you can copy bits of HTML from other pages that do
what you want, then change the text! This page shows on the left as it appears in your
browser, and the coressponding HTML code appears on the right. The HTML commands are linked
to explanations of what they do.

<h3>Line breaks</h3>
<p style="font-family:times new roman">HTML doesn't normally use line breaks for ordinary text.A
white space of any size is treated as a single space .The code type of format can also be used in html for
example
</p>
<font size="1" color="red">
<code>
#include&it;iostream.h&gt;<br>
void main()<br>
{<br>
cout<<"This is a simple programm";<br>
}<br>
</code>
</font>
<left>
<p>

If you want to put multiple spaces,then you can use non breaking space entity by multiple times.For ex,I
would like to use 3 more blank spaces &nbsp;&nbsp; here.If you want put a line break at a particular
place,you can use the "&lt;"br"&gt;" command ,or,for a paragraph break,the "&lt;"p"&gt;"command
,which will insert a blank line.You can also use some extended text formating features such as
superscript and mark features like this
</p>
<p>
<font size="1" color="black">
1<sup>st</sup>,2<sub>nd</sub><mark> mark</mark> and<em><i> emphasized format features.

<p style="font-family:calibiri" ><pre> Most HTML commands come in pairs: for example
,"&lt"h4"&gt" marks the beginning of a size 4 heading,
and "&lt;"/H4"&gt;" marks the end of it. &nbsp; The closing command is always the same as the
opening command, except for the addition of </pre></p>
<h2 align=RIGHT>This is a size "3" heading</h2>
